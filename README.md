    <h1>Miata Downforce Measurement</h1>
    <p>This project provides a Python program to measure downforce in a Miata using load cells and a MegaSquirt ECU. Below are the instructions to set up and run the program.</p>
    
<h2>Requirements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Load cells</li>
        <li>Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino)</li>
        <li><code>pyserial</code> library for Python</li>
    </ul>

<p>This is a basic example to get you started. You will need to adjust the program based on your specific hardware setup, including the number of load cells and their placement on your Miata. Additionally, you may need to calibrate the load cells to get accurate measurements.</p>
